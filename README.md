# Support-Vector-Machines
This assignment focuses on implementing image classification using Support Vector Classifier (SVC) on the MNIST dataset and regression analysis using Support Vector Regression (SVR) on the California Housing dataset. The tasks involve model training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning.

#Features
## Support Vector Classification on MNIST dataset:

Data preparation and normalization

Model training with different kernels (linear, polynomial, RBF)

Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV

Evaluation and reporting of model performance

Visualization of confusion matrix

## Support Vector Regression on California Housing dataset:

Data preparation and splitting

Model training with default parameters

Evaluation using mean squared error (MSE)

Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV

Visualization of predictions vs. ground truth
